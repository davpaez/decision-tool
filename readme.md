DecisionTool creates decision trees with reusable action spaces and chance spaces for enumerating all possible outcomes and calculating expected value of a multi-dimensional utility vector for all terminal nodes.

# Roadmap

## Version 0.1
* Create trees composed of nodes, discrete action spaces and discrete chance spaces.
* Implement modular spaces (action and chance) so that a space can be located at many nodes, so that it represents the same decision or random event.
* Assign multi-dimension utility to any node
* Assign probability to the options of a chance space
* Calculate multi-dimension utility of any terminal node
* Calculate probability of any terminal node

## Version 0.2
* Add graphical representation of the decision tree.
* Concatenate several spaces as the representation of a cross product between their options

## Version 1.0


## Version 2.0
* Add cotinuous action spaces
* Add continuous chance spaces
*
